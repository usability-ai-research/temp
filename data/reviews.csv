Machine learning (ML) solutions have raised user and academic awareness of technical innovation. As a result, ML is becoming increasingly popular to improve the quality of UX. Several investigations have highlighted a potential lack of studies on the overall challenges and recommendations for UX using ML. Therefore, more attention should be paid to ML’s existence and potential applications across various applications to get the most out of ML techniques to improve the UX design process. To this objective, a systematic review of the literature was performed as to determine the challenges faced by UX designers when incorporating ML in their design process. Recommendations that help UX designers incorporate ML into UX design will be highlighted. Furthermore, the PRISMA approach is used (a process that has been established in the literature), to restrict the chance of bias at the selection stage. Relevant articles in the following four databases were searched: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM. The findings revealed that the number of publications on issues linked to UX with ML had advanced exponentially.

Mobile device applications have additional limitations to convey good user experiences (UX) due to the usage and features of mobile devices in ubiquitous computing contexts. There are a lot of automated tools available for evaluating, such applications particularly developed for Android and iOS. Automated UX evaluation provides a number of strengths which are able to overcome the limitations of non-automated (moderated) counterparts. Automated UX evaluation is regarded as unexplored field, especially when it is adopted for the UX evaluation of complex mobile application. Despite these, automated UX evaluation tools are unexplored and should only be used in coupling with traditional UX evaluation techniques. Hence, this study aims to discuss the literature in automated UX evaluation and to highlight the UX measurements that merit further investigation. This paper presents the most fre-quently used automated UX evaluation tools for mobile applications. Therefore, the study analyzes existing automated UX tools and frameworks and identifies which UX attributes and measurements of automated UX evaluation are likely to be of use in future research. Moreover, we discuss the strengths and limitations of automated UX evaluation methods for mobile applications. Finally, the paper provides an overview of automated UX evaluation techniques and tools.

It is highly advantageous for GUI designers and application developers to analyze the visual complexity of a GUI and predict users’ perception and judgment during the design phase. Although in recent years, various methods have been developed for visual complexity analysis, these have not been widely used due to applicability, practicality and validity issues. In this respect, we have conducted a comprehensive review of studies and methods in visual complexity analysis. After identifying and analyzing 85 research studies, we grouped the visual complexity analysis methods and accordingly a taxonomy is presented. Furthermore, conceptual comparison of the methods is given and gap analysis as well as possible future directions are provided. According to the our findings, major gaps for each visual complexity analysis method may be stated as follows: 1) In metric-model based methods, there is a lack of information about the suitability of the metric-model created for analysis, since the extent to which each metric contributes to visual complexity analysis is still not known exactly. 2) In heuristic- based methods, the extracted rule set is not yet extendable enough beyond the use for specific GUIs. 3) While the visual complexity analysis could be considered as a kind of computer vision task, there exist limited studies that does so. Therefore, generalizable solutions based on machine learning techniques seem to be a promising research direction to develop efficient approaches.",Graphical user interface design; GUI evaluation; Visual complexity analysis; Complexity perception,6,Q2,Taxonomy of visual complexity assessment methods,no,-,no

While these disadvantages can be a bit daunting despite the benefits they provide, some tools can automatically generate and support usability testing. We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the tools that support automatic usability evaluation. We identified a total of 15 primary studies.

We derived an inventory of ML’s impact on current UXR activities and practitioners’ predictions about its potentials. We learned that ML methods may help to automate mundane tasks, complement decisions with data-driven insights, and enrich UXR with insights from users’ emotional worlds. Challenges may arise from a potential obligation to utilize data and a more restrictive access to user data.

However, certain problems and challenges have been identified at the time of their execution. In this study we present the results of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify case studies, challenges, problems, and opportunities on the execution of heuristic evaluations in the context of a research for the automation and formalization of the process. For this SLR, we have employed the protocol proposed by Kitchenham and Charters. The research was carried out on September 7 of 2020 and retrieved a total of 167 studies of which 37 were selected for this review. The results show that the main challenges are related to the low suitability of the chosen set of heuristics and the low expertise of usability evaluators. Additionally, we have identified that exist very few software solutions that support and automate the process. Finally, we have found that there were many protocols to follow when applying a heuristic evaluation, like the definition of new usability heuristics for a given case of study. According to the results obtained, we can conclude that it is necessary to develop and validate a tool based on a formal protocol that supports and automate the heuristic evaluation process, that gives solutions to the challenges and opportunities identified in this research. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Case-studies; Challenge; Heuristic evaluation; Heuristic methods; Human computer interaction; Inspection methods; Opportunity; Problems and challenges; Systematic literature review; Usability engineering; Usability inspection; Usability problems; User tests,11,B,Heuristic evaluation applications,yes,37,no

Therefore, we performed a systematic mapping to provide an overview comparing the existing approaches from the last ten years (2010–2020). We encountered 27 articles reporting different approach types, including assessments measuring user perception of visual esthetics via human responses, metrics based on GUI elements, extracting handcrafted features from GUI screenshots, and deep-learning-based approaches. Most of them implement objective approaches, either using metrics or feature extraction. The majority of the approaches are aimed at web GUIs, with only three focusing on mobile GUIs, considering their smaller screen size, less use of color, and a more vertical element alignment. Few approaches have been comprehensively evaluated regarding reliability and validity. These results indicate the need for further research considering the importance of visual esthetics as part of software quality.

In recent years, new technological approaches have been emerging to quantify usability testing data and improve process automation. Eye tracking technology is a great way to analyze users’ interaction with the product, allowing researchers to discover usability issues and even leverage the power of machine learning to recognize various kinds of emotions linked to users’ interactions. Existing research concerned with these three main topics has been methodically explored. For this review, we extensively searched 1988 theme-related articles. One hundred and forty-four articles were selected based on meticulous screening, from which 90 were included in this systematic review.

However, existing UX evaluation methods tend to require high levels of human involvement in data collection and analysis.

Thus, there is a strong demand in developing UX evaluation systems that are able to automatically track UX and provide insights on required design improvements. The few existing frameworks for such automated systems can help identify user-centric metrics for UX evaluation, but mostly focus on providing recommendations on best practices of determining metrics and tend to reflect only parts of the UX. Moreover, these frameworks predominantly rely on high-level UX concepts, but do not necessarily allow measurements to reveal the underlying causes of UX challenges.

The responses could be reflected in pattern changes of the subject’s facial expression, gesture, gait, eye-movement, physiological signals, speech and voice, keystroke, and mouse dynamics, etc. This suggests that on the one hand emotions can be measured/recognized from the responses, and on the other hand they can be facilitated/regulated by external stimulus events, situation changes or internal motivation changes. It is well-known that emotion has a close relationship with both physical and mental health, usually affecting an individual’s and a team’s work performance, thus emotion recognition is an important prerequisite for emotion regulation towards better emotional states and work performance. The primary problem in emotion recognition is how to recognize a subject’s emotional states easily and accurately. Currently, there are a body of good research on emotion recognition from facial expression, gesture, gait, eye-tracking, and other physiological signals such as speech and voice, but they are all intrusive and obtrusive to some extent. In contrast, keystroke, mouse and touchscreen (KMT) dynamics data can be collected non-intrusively and unobtrusively as secondary data responding to primary physical actions, thus, this paper aims to review the state-of-the-art research on emotion recognition from KMT dynamics and to identify key research challenges, opportunities and a future research roadmap for referencing. In addition, this paper answers the following six research questions (RQs): (1) what are the commonly used emotion elicitation methods and databases for emotion recognition?
